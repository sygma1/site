        <p>A social network is a social structure made up of a set of social
          actors (such as individuals or organizations), sets of dyadic ties,
          and other social interactions between actors.<br>
          The social network perspective provides a set of methods for analyzing
          the structure of whole social entities as well as a variety of
          theories explaining the patterns observed in these structures.<br>
          [1] The study of these structures uses social network analysis to
          identify local and global patterns, locate influential entities, and
          examine network dynamics.<br>
          Social networks and the analysis of them is an inherently
          interdisciplinary academic field which emerged from social psychology,
          sociology, statistics, and graph theory.<br>
          Georg Simmel authored early structural theories in sociology
          emphasizing the dynamics of triads and "web of group affiliations".[2]
          Jacob Moreno is credited with developing the first sociograms in the
          1930s to study interpersonal relationships.<br>
          These approaches were mathematically formalized in the 1950s and
          theories and methods of social networks became pervasive in the social
          and behavioral sciences by the 1980s.<br>
          [1][3] Social network analysis is now one of the major paradigms in
          contemporary sociology, and is also employed in a number of other
          social and formal sciences.<br>
          Together with other complex networks, it forms part of the nascent
          field of network science.[4][5]</p>
